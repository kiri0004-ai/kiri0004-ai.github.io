    <p>My name is Venelin Kirilov, I am 18 years old and I come from Bulgaria. I have lived there <br>
        before moving to the Netherlands to pursue my higher education.</p>
    <p>Alongside these jobs, I also pursued a small entrepreneurial project by buying second-hand laptops,<br>
        repairing and refurbishing them, and then reselling them for a modest profit. This activity not only helped
        me<br>
        develop technical skills but also gave me insight into business, problem-solving, and handling transactions
        independently.</p>
    <p>Just three days after graduating from high school, I moved to the Netherlands to begin my next chapter.<br>
        I started with a summer job to help cover part of my university and housing expenses. Shortly after,<br>
        I began studying at HZ University of Applied Sciences.</p>
